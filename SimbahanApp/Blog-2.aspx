          <h3 class ="writer" align="center">By <b>Faye Pascua - </b> April 10, 2017</h3>
          <br/>
          
          <p class="p1"><span style="white-space: nowrap; text-align: center"> Aside from our world-class beach resorts and our famous Filipino hospitality, Philippines is also known as a predominantly Catholic country, something we inherited after <br/>300 years of being under the Spaniards.  Only third from Brazil and Mexico in terms of Catholic Population, 81.4% or over 81 million Filipinos are Catholics. Our culture has<br/> been heavily shaped by Catholicism to the point that some Catholic traditions, such as the Sinulog Festival, has become a tourist attraction in the country.  
          </span></p><br/>

          <p class="p1">Now, it’s that time of the year again.  As the Holy Week approaches, Catholics all over the country now prepare for its week-long rites & rituals, one of which is the Visita Iglesia (Spanish for “Church Visit”), a tradition where Catholics visit 14 churches (sometimes 7) as a gesture of Catholics joining Jesus’ in a vigil before his Passion and Death on the Cross.</p><br/>

          	<h1 class="church1"> 1. Manila Cathedral</h1><br/>
          	<img class="cubao" src="Images/ManilaCathedral.jpg"/><br/>
          	<p class="cap"><caption><b>Address:</b> Cabildo cor. Baeterio St., Intramuros, Manila</caption></p>
            <p class="p1">Formally called Manila Metropolitan Cathedral-Basilica and home of the Archbishop of Manila, Manila Cathedral has been a venue for Papal masses in the country, the most recent of which was celebrated by Pope Francis last January 26, 2015.  Manila Cathedral is a basilica dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary as our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. Aside from its Romanesque* design, I find the interior of the Cathedral a sight to watch because of its Italian inspired artworks and its beautifully designed stained glasses.</p><br/>

           <div class="col-md-12">
          	<h1 class="church2"> 2. Binondo Church</h1><br/>
          	<img class="cubao" src="Images/Binondo Church.JPG" /><br/>
          	<p class="cap"><caption><b>Address:</b> Plaza Lorenzo Ruiz, Binondo, Manila</caption></p>
             <p class="p1">Binondo Church is also known as Minor Basilica of Saint Lorenzo Ruiz (The 1st Philippines Saint) and Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary Parish. Research dictates that got its architectural inspiration from the Spanish and European Baroque Style.  But what I really liked about this Church is that while the front has heavy shades of gray brick cement, its inside is actually nicely painted pink? & white.  The realistic paintings in the ceiling and the altar which looks like a façade of another church is really worth seeing.</p><br/>
          </div>

          
          <div class="col-md-12">
          	<h1 class="church3"> 3. Quiapo Church</h1><br/>
          	<img class="cubao" src="Images/quaipochurch.jpg"/><br/>
          	<p class="cap"><caption><b>Address:</b> 910 Plaza Miranda, Quiapo, Manila </caption></p>
            <p class="p1">Another Baroque Style inspired Church, Quiapo Church is one of the most famous Churches in the country mainly because it is home to the Black Nazarene, a popularly venerated statue of Jesus Christ carrying the cross, which many believe (myself included) has miraculous attributes. Officially known as Minor Basilica of the Black Nazarene, the outside of the church is painted creamy white with various statues of saints.  The inside is plain, simple and spacious focusing the Black Nazarene as the centerpiece.</p><br/>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-12">
          	<h1 class="church4"> 4. San Sebastian Church</h1><br/>
          	<img class="cubao" src="Images/6892561_orig.jpg"/><br/>
          	<p class="cap"><caption><b>Address:</b> Plaza del Carmen, Quiapo, Manila </caption></p>
            <p class="p1">Situated in a peaceful & less hectic corner of Quiapo area resides the Basílica Menor de San Sebastiá, more commonly known as the San Sebastian Church.  With a Gothic architectural design, this church is a declared a National Cultural Landmark and National Cultural Treasure as this is the only all-steel church in Asia.  While it is made of steel, surprisingly, the interior of San Sebastian Church looks like it’s made of stone.  It’s a high-ceilinged church even made more stunning by its beautiful stained glass window and pointed, Gothic-inspired altar at its center. Above the main altar is an image of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.</p><br/>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-12">
          	<h1 class="church4"> 5. San Beda Church</h1><br/>
          	<img class="cubao" src="Images/2242824791_9a09112211_b.jpg"/><br/>
          	<p class="cap"><caption><b>Address:</b> 638 Mendiola St., San Miguel, Manila </caption></p>
            <p class="p1">Formally known as Abbey of Our Lady of Montserrat, San Beda Church is the mother church of the Benedictine Monks in the Philippines.  At a single glance, the church’s facade is not easily noticeable as the Church is covered with trees and as it blends in with the building structures of the colleges and universities in Mendiola.  Similar to the San Sebastian Church, San Beda church is also designed using neo-gothic inspiration. But what really struck me the most was the inside.  The moment you enter, you will definitely be marveled by the magnificent paintings balanced by the refreshing colors of the interior.  Easily one of the most beautiful Churches in the country for me.</p><br/>

          <div class="col-md-12">
          	<h1 class="church4"> 6. Twin Churches of Sampaloc</h1><br/>
          	<img class="cubao" src="Images/Sampaloc_twin_churches.JPG"/><br/>
          	<p class="cap"><caption><b>Address:</b> Jose Figueras St., Sampaloc, Manila </caption></p>
            <p class="p1">In the busy district of Sampaloc, resides two adjacent churches: (1) Archdiocesan Shrine of Our Lady of Loreto, and (2) Saint Anthony Shrine. As a predominantly Catholic country, one would expect Churches to spring in each barangay / municipality.  But, to literary be built adjacent to each other, that’s a rare one.  Coined as the Twin Churches of Sampaloc (Bustillos), both churches are administered by Franciscans.  Visiting this during your Visita Iglesia would be a time-saver as you’ll tick two counts in one area.</p><br/>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-12">
          	<h1 class="church4"> 7. Santa Cruz Church</h1><br/>
          	<img class="cubao" src="Images/Santa_Cruz_Church_Main_Facade.jpg"/><br/>
          	<p class="cap"><caption><b>Address:</b> Santa Cruz, Manila </caption></p>
            <p class="p1">Santa Cruz church is a Baroque-inspired Church located at Santa Cruz Manila. Originally built in the early 1600s, this church sustained major damages before its current reconstructed design.  The highlight for me is its façade: a wonderful play of brick design and white outline, bell towers, topped with a statue of Our Lady of the Pillar (the Church’s patroness). The plaza at the front also has beautiful fountain called the Carriedo Fountain.</p><br/>
          </div>


          <div class="col-md-12">
          	<h1 class="church4"> 8. Ermita Church</h1><br/>
          	<img class="cubao" src="Images/9048796550_4f8327067b_b.jpg"/><br/>
          	<p class="cap"><caption><b>Address:</b> MH del Pilar St. cor. Flores St. Ermita, Manila, Philippines </caption></p>
            <p class="p1">The Ermita Church is home to the Marian image of Our Lady of Guidance (Nuestra Señora de Guia) which is considered as the oldest image in the Philippines. Formally known as Archdiocesan Shrine of Our Lady of Guidance, the church looks simple from the outside with its shades of white. However, the inside is magnificent to watch as the hanging chandeliers illuminates the nice paintings in the ceiling. Moreover, the center looks like the “heaven has opened and out comes the altar” through its wonderful background.</p><br/>
          </div>


          <div class="col-md-12">
          	<h1 class="church4"> 9. Malate Church</h1><br/>
          	<img class="cubao" src="Images/iglesia-de-malate.jpg"/><br/>
          	<p class="cap"><caption><b>Address:</b>  2000 M.H. Del Pilar St., Malate, Manila</caption></p>
            <p class="p1">One of the oldest church in the country, Malate Church, formally known as Our Lady of Remedies Parish, has undergone multiple restorations. Unlike other old Churches, its façade has not been freshly repainted and is very evident of the age. The inside, however, is a complete opposite; the altar itself is like a golden church.  The facing the church is the beautiful Rajah Sulayman Park, making Malate Church look like a lost temple in a jungle of trees when viewed from afar. </p><br/>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-12">
          	<h1 class="church4"> 10. San Agustin Church</h1><br/>
          	<img class="cubao" src="Images/san-agustin-church.jpg"/><br/>
          	<p class="cap"><caption><b>Address:</b>   181 Gen. Luna St., Intramuros, Manila </caption></p>
             <p class="p1">San Agustin Church, also called Archdiocesan Shrine of Our Lady of Correa, is the only church in the country to have survived multiple earthquakes recorded, including the great earthquake in 1863.  Designated as a World Heritage Site and a National Historical Landmark, this Baroque styled church looks plain and old from the outside, but has a magnificent interior.  Its walls and ceilings are of “trompe l’oeil” painting, which is apparently an art technique which makes the subject appear three dimensional. It also houses the remains of prominent people in Philippine history including Juan Luna and Miguel Lopez de Legaspi.  Located in the historical Intramuros, San Agustin Church is a site to visit. </p><br/>

          <p class="p1">Honestly, with so many beautiful Churches in the City of Manila, it’s difficult to limit the list to just 10 churches.   However, for purposes of the upcoming Visita Iglesia, here are some beautiful churches as well that are within close premises:</p><br/>
